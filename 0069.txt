[tp:0.03]What do you think of the hotel? We take[p]pride in the luxury and splendor it offers![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Is something the matter?[tp:0.3] [/tp]I hope nothing[p]is making your stay here less than perfect...[pb]Our entire staff is devoted to providing you with[p]the ideal vacation experience![tp:0.3] [/tp]Heh heh heh...[/tp]
[tp:0.03]It looks like you haven't checked in[p]yet.[tp:0.3] [/tp]Please make your way to the[p]front desk. It's right over there...[/tp]
[tp:0.03]My apologies for the inconvenience, but the[p][clr:FFE98B]elevator[/clr] is temporarily out of service.[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]We should have it in tip-top shape soon![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Please make yourself comfortable...[tp:0.3] [/tp]Perhaps[p]you'd like to sample our selection of beverages?[/tp]
[tp:0.03]This hotel is so big, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp]It's gorgeously[p]decorated too! We're so lucky to have[p]gotten an invitation to come here![tp:0.3] [/tp]Hee hee![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Hhhhrrrrgggg![tp:0.3] [/tp][clr:FE7388]Princess Peach[/clr] definitely[p]didn't forget to pack anything...[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Ah, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp]What's up?[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Ahhhhh! Oh no![/tp]
[tp:0.03]My head's stuck! I can't get out![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Welcome, guests, to [clr:FFE98B]The Last Resort[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp][p]Are you ready to check in?[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Woof? (Time to rest?)[/tp]
Welcome to [clr:FFE98B]The Last Resort[/clr], home of the[p]most memorable vacations ever had!
[tp:0.03]Oh, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], where are you going?[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]Let's get checked in at the front desk.[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Not a problem at all. Make yourself comfortable.[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]Please come see me when you're ready.[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Guests![tp:0.3] [/tp]Welcome to [clr:FFE98B]The Last Resort[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03]My name is [clr:FA96FD]Hellen Gravely[/clr], and[p]I am the owner of this hotel.[/tp]
[tp:0.03]I am absolutely delighted that you[p]decided to accept my invitation.[/tp]
[tp:0.03]You all must be very tired. Come![p]Allow me to show you to your rooms.[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Oh, no need to worry about your luggage![p]Our exceptional staff will take care of it for you...[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Ha ha ha...[tp:0.3] [/tp]You're our VIPs, after all![/tp]
[tp:0.03]We've prepared a first-rate experience[p]for you. All the trappings of luxury![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Shall we get going?[/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:FE7388]Mario[/clr], [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], and [clr:FE7388]Peach[/clr]'s rooms are over here.[/tp]
[tp:0.03]We've prepared rooms for you [clr:FE7388]Toads[/clr] as well![/tp]
[tp:0.03]I hope you enjoy your stay! I daresay you'll[p]remember it for the rest of your lives![tp:0.3] [/tp]Ha ha ha...[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Well well well! If it isn't my MOST esteemed[p]VIP![tp:0.3] [/tp]I was just on my way to see you...[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Is your room living up to your expectations?[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]Doesn't it SCREAM good taste?[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Oh, I can barely contain myself.[tp:0.3] [/tp]You have no idea[p]how much I wanted you to accept my invitation![/tp]
[tp:0.03]"Why is that?" I'm sure you're[p]wondering.[tp:0.3] [/tp]Ha ha ha... You see...[/tp]
[tp:0.03]There is someone I truly adore![tp:0.3] [/tp][p]He's the inspiration for some of my[p]greatest ideas...[tp:0.3] [/tp]Like inviting you here![/tp]
[tp:0.03]I'm such a huge fan of his![tp:0.3] [/tp]That's why it's so[p]wonderful that I get to introduce him to...[/tp]
[tp:0.03]YOU![tp:0.3] [/tp]That's right, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03]I hope you're ready![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Mwah ha ha! Surprise, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp][p]It's-a me,[tp:0.3] [/tp][clr:B996DC]King Boo[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03]That old coot had me locked up tight in his lab...[/tp]
[tp:0.03]But guess what? I GOT OUT![tp:0.3] [/tp]The [clr:FA96FD]hotel[p]owner [/clr]here was just dying to meet me,[p]so she busted me out.[tp:0.3] [/tp]Pretty lucky, huh?[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Anyway, I didn't think you'd actually show up[p]here.[tp:0.3] [/tp]I was ready though, just in case.[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]In fact, my vengeance is nearly complete![/tp]
[tp:0.03]What do I mean by "vengeance"?[tp:0.3] [/tp]Glad you asked![/tp]
[tp:0.03]I'm trapping you and everyone in your[p]little vacation party...[tp:0.1]in frames![/tp][/tp]
[tp:0.03]Awww, there there, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]. It'll all be over soon.[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]It's time for a family reunion! BOO-YA![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Mwah ha ha![tp:0.3] [/tp]Take THAT![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Oh, and there's one more frame, of course.[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]I saved it especially for you![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Stay right there and put on your best[p]terrified face, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp]This is game over![/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]! I told you that the [clr:FFE98B]elevator[/clr] is that[p]way![tp:0.3] [/tp]Why even consider using the stairs[p]when there is a perfectly good [clr:FFE98B]elevator[/clr]?[/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], where do you think you're going?![tp:0.3] [/tp][p]We need to hurry up and get to my car![/tp]
[tp:0.03]We passed it, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp]That isn't the [clr:FFE98B]garage[/clr] door![/tp]
[tp:0.03]You have to blind him with the [clr:5AFEFF]Strobulb[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp][p]Use it when you've got a clear shot![/tp]
[tp:0.03]What are you doing, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]?[tp:0.3] [/tp]Head for the [clr:FFE98B]elevator[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Hey, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr].[tp:0.3] [/tp]Take a look over there.[/tp]
[tp:0.03]The [clr:FFE98B]elevator[/clr] will get us to the [clr:FFE98B]garage [/clr]in an[p]instant.[tp:0.3] [/tp]Let's hurry up before the ghosts find us![/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], this isn't where we need to be right[p]now.[tp:0.3] [/tp]Our business is in the [clr:FFE98B]garage[/clr]![/tp]
Install the Elevator Tracker
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], where are you heading off to?[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]Aren't you curious what he dropped?[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Time is critical, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr].[tp:0.3] [/tp]You should hurry[p]and get the [clr:5AFEFF]elevator tracker[/clr] installed![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Ah![tp:0.3] [/tp]If it isn't [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp]You are precisely the last[p]person I'd expect to find here.[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Hold that thought—now isn't the time to[p]catch up. What matters is...you'll do nicely![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Come on, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr].[tp:0.3] [/tp]Get me out of here now![/tp]
[tp:0.03]This hotel is filled to the brim with[p]ghosts![tp:0.3] [/tp]Let's make a run for it![/tp]
[tp:0.03]What was that?[tp:0.3] [/tp]All of your[p]friends have been captured?![/tp]
[tp:0.03]And you can't just abandon them here, you say?[/tp]
[tp:0.03]You're the same as ever, I see.[tp:0.3] [/tp]A bit of a handful...[/tp]
[tp:0.03]OK.[tp:0.3] [/tp]I'm not thrilled about it, but I,[tp:0.3] [/tp][p][clr:FE7388]Professor Elvin Gadd[/clr],[tp:0.3] [/tp]have an idea![/tp]
[tp:0.03]First things first, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr].[tp:0.3] [/tp]We have to get[p]to my car![tp:0.3] [/tp]Will you take me there?[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Hey. The new [clr:5AFEFF]Poltergust G-00[/clr] you're wearing...[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]You took that out of my car, right?[/tp]
[tp:0.03]We've got to get back to the[p]underground [clr:FFE98B]garage[/clr].[tp:0.3] [/tp]Let's go![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Of all the...[tp:0.3] [/tp]Someone has removed[p]all the other [clr:5AFEFF]elevator buttons[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03]What's going on here?[/tp]
[tp:0.03][tp:0.3]Hmm...[/tp] A mystery for later, I suppose.[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]Go ahead and give that [clr:FFE98B]B1[/clr] [clr:5AFEFF]button[/clr] a push.[/tp]
[tp:0.03]It didn't seem like any of your friends[p]were trapped on [clr:FFE98B]2F[/clr] with me...[/tp]
[tp:0.03]They must have been taken to one of the floors[p]higher up in the hotel. Which means...[tp:0.3] [/tp]Yeah,[p]we're going to need those [clr:5AFEFF]elevator buttons[/clr].[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Ho ho![tp:0.3] [/tp]Those are definitely the [clr:5AFEFF]elevator buttons[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp][p]I never would've guessed a ghost had taken them![/tp]
[tp:0.03]But...there are only two.[tp:0.3] [/tp]Maybe there are other[p]ghosts out there with the rest of the [clr:5AFEFF]buttons[/clr]?[/tp]
[tp:0.03]No matter.[tp:0.3] [/tp]Let's go to my car.[tp:0.3] [/tp]I've got something [p]very interesting that I want to show you![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Heh heh heh![tp:0.3] [/tp]Welcome to my [clr:FFE98B]lab[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03]This is another of my brilliant[p]inventions—a portable laboratory![p]It's sturdy, safe, and air conditioned![/tp]
[tp:0.03]I always knew I'd need this one day.[p]Good thing I brought it along with me, right?[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Hmm? You want to know what I'm doing in this[p]hotel?[tp:0.3] [/tp]It's a bit of a long story, but in short...[/tp]
[tp:0.03]I was tricked.[/tp]
[tp:0.03]I got an invitation from someone[p]claiming to own this hotel.[/tp]
[tp:0.03]They said they had a precious collection of[p]ghosts, gathered from all over the world![/tp]
[tp:0.03]No self-respecting ghost researcher would pass[p]up on such an appealing offer, obviously![/tp]
[tp:0.03]I accepted their invitation, but when[p]I arrived...[tp:0.3] [/tp]The invitation was only a ruse![/tp]
[tp:0.03]They captured me and took[p]my precious ghost collection![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Uuugh![tp:0.3] [/tp]That includes all those ghosts you'd[p]worked so hard to catch for me before![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Even [clr:B996DC]King Boo[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp]Losing him really got[p]under my skin![tp:0.3] [/tp]He's my favorite...[/tp]
[tp:0.03]What?[tp:0.3] [/tp]They've released [clr:B996DC]King Boo[/clr]?![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Ugh![tp:0.3] [/tp]That [clr:FA96FD]hotel owner[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp]What has she done?![/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp]You're our only hope! Against all odds,[p]without any hesitation, and at any cost...[/tp]
[tp:0.03]get my ghost collection back![/tp]
[tp:0.03]And speaking of ghost collections, why don't you[p]give me all of the ghosts you've captured so far![/tp]
[tp:0.03]All right![tp:0.3] [/tp]Keep on catching those ghosts. [p]Oh, and be sure to come back to the [clr:FFE98B]lab[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03]I'll set up the [clr:FFE98B]gallery[/clr] so that you can[p]view the ghosts that you've captured![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Hm?[tp:0.3] [/tp]What's with that look, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]?[p]Am I forgetting something important?[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Oh.[tp:0.3] [/tp]Oh![tp:0.3] [/tp]That's right! I forgot about saving your[p]friends and family. Completely and totally forgot.[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Regardless![tp:0.3] [/tp]To find ghosts and your[p]friends, you'll need to explore this hotel![/tp]
[tp:0.03]To help you out, I'll give you one[p]of my greatest inventions yet![/tp]
[tp:0.03]I call it...the [clr:5AFEFF]Virtual Boo[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp][clr:5AFEFF]VB[/clr] for short![/tp]
[tp:0.03]It's a state-of-the-art virtual-reality device fitted[p]with a fancy red screen![tp:0.3] [/tp]Really cutting-edge stuff![p]And red is all the rage, you know?[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Just wait until I finish the marketing materials[p]on this! It'll fly off the shelves![tp:0.3] [/tp]Heh heh heh![/tp]
[tp:0.03]You can use the [clr:5AFEFF]VB[/clr] to communicate[p]with me at any time.[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Hey, maybe we can test out the[p]communications system later...[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Press {0} to look into the [clr:5AFEFF]VB[/clr].[tp:0.3] [/tp]It'll display your[p]current objective for you too. It's quite useful![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Oh, and I have one more thing to give you.[/tp]
[tp:0.03]The very first thing you need to do is install this[p][clr:5AFEFF]elevator tracker[/clr] inside the [clr:FFE98B]elevator[/clr] for me, OK?[/tp]
[tp:0.03]As for what it is[tp:0.3].[/tp].[tp:0.3].[/tp] I'll tell you[p]later! Go on and get it installed![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Head for the [clr:FFE98B]elevator[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp]I'm counting on you, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Hello, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp]It seems like the[p]installation was a success![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Now then. As to what that device[p]actually does...[tp:0.3] [/tp]Well, it extracts map[p]data about the floors from the [clr:FFE98B]elevator[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Then it takes all that data and displays[p]it on the monitor![tp:0.3] [/tp]Isn't that great?[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Hey, why don't you take those [clr:5AFEFF]elevator buttons[/clr][p]you collected and insert them into the panel?[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Now you're able to view the map of a new floor![/tp]
[tp:0.03]There's another surprise, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr].[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]That device links with the [clr:5AFEFF]Virtual Boo[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03]The map data is automatically sent to the [clr:5AFEFF]VB[/clr],[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]so you can view the map anywhere, anytime![/tp]
[tp:0.03]If you open the [clr:FFA500]map[/clr] from the [clr:5AFEFF]VB[/clr] menu,[p]you can check out an even more detailed[p]map. Don't go forgetting about it, OK?[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Let me break it down for you, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp]The map[p]is super helpful for exploring new floors...[/tp]
[tp:0.03]While you're exploring the hotel, you[p]should hunt down the [clr:5AFEFF]elevator buttons[/clr]...[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Those [clr:5AFEFF]buttons[/clr] will let you reach new floors,[p]ripe for exploration![tp:0.3] [/tp]Oh, and you might find[p]your friends there.[tp:0.3] [/tp]Heh heh heh![/tp]
[tp:0.03]One more thing before you go, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]. We need to do[p]a quick test of the [clr:5AFEFF]VB[/clr]'s communication system.[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Open the [clr:5AFEFF]VB[/clr] with {0}, and select the [clr:FFA500]E. Gadd[p]Hotline[/clr]. I'm counting on you, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Woooof? (Comfortable with what you learned?)[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Hey, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]! Look at that...[tp:0.3] [/tp]It's money, and lots[p]of it! Even with all the dangers here, I'm sure[p]we agree that money is still important![tp:0.3] [/tp][p]The ghosts don't seem interested in grabbing[p]it...[tp:0.3] [/tp]What's the saying? "You can't take it[p]with you"?[tp:0.3] [/tp]Well, I definitely want it anyway![p]Keep your eyes peeled, and grab as much as you[p]can![tp:0.3] [/tp]You know, while you're capturing ghosts[p]and saving your friends. Multitasking![/tp]
[tp:0.12]...[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Testing... Testing... One, two, three... [p]This is [clr:FE7388]E. Gadd[/clr], resident genius![p]Am I coming through loud and clear?[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Fantastic![tp:0.3] [/tp]It appears that the [clr:5AFEFF]VB[/clr]'s communication[p]system is working perfectly![tp:0.3] [/tp]That means you can[p]use this to contact me anytime you need to![/tp]
[tp:0.03]If you feel the need to talk to me, just do exactly[p]what you did for the test, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp]I may be able[p]to offer some advice in a tough situation![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Oh![tp:0.3] [/tp]You can also check out the log using the very[p]same system. Let me know if that's why you're[p]calling, and you'll be able to see your progress![/tp]
[tp:0.03]OK! Testing my inventions is fun, but we[p]should get back to work.[tp:0.3] [/tp]And speaking[p]of work... I have a job for you![/tp]
[tp:0.03]So you're able to take the elevator[p]up to [clr:FFE98B]5F [/clr]now, right?[tp:0.3] [/tp]I was actually[p]staying in a room on that floor...[/tp]
[tp:0.03]There's a [clr:5AFEFF]briefcase[/clr] in my room.[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]Could you fetch it for me, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]?[/tp]
[tp:0.03]My room number is...[tp:0.3] [/tp]Oh blast, what was it?[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]Eh, you've got a map. You'll figure it out![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Good luck, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]! Try to come[p]back alive![tp:0.3] [/tp]Heh heh heh![/tp]
Contact E. Gadd Using the Virtual Boo
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]! Where are you going?[tp:0.3] [/tp]We need to test out[p]the [clr:5AFEFF]VB[/clr]'s communication system! Go ahead and[p]open the [clr:5AFEFF]VB[/clr] with {0}, and select [clr:FFA500]E. Gadd Hotline[/clr].[/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], I can't have you going off and exploring[p]without a fully tested communication system![tp:0.3] [/tp][p]Open the [clr:5AFEFF]VB[/clr] with {0} and select [clr:FFA500]E. Gadd Hotline[/clr].[/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]! Hurry up and start the [clr:5AFEFF]VB[/clr] communication[p]test![tp:0.3] [/tp]You should try calling me. Press {0} to look[p]into the [clr:5AFEFF]VB[/clr], and then select [clr:FFA500]E. Gadd Hotline[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Ah, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr].[tp:0.3] [/tp]I just remembered something[p]important I neglected to mention...[pb]That [clr:5AFEFF]Poltergust G-00[/clr] of yours has a new feature[p]that I like to call...[clr:5AFEFF]Suction Shot[/clr]! It'll work[p]as a weapon for you on your adventures![p]Use  to fire the rubber plunger—you can[p]stick it on to flat and smooth surfaces.[pb]And if you use the [clr:5AFEFF]Poltergust G-00[/clr] to suck up the[p]rope and then press , you can tug on objects[p]and pull off a powerful slam to break them![p]You should start shooting it at things right[p]away! Practice makes perfect, after all![pb]Oh, and don't forget to get my[p][clr:5AFEFF]briefcase[/clr], [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp]Heh heh heh![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Ooh, she's a hard one to catch![tp:0.3] [/tp]We'll have to[p]outwit her if we want to have any chance.[pb]That [clr:5AFEFF]briefcase[/clr] she swallowed is flat and sturdy...[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]Maybe you can grab on to it with a [clr:5AFEFF]Suction Shot[/clr]?[/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]! Aim the [clr:5AFEFF]Suction Shot[/clr] at my [clr:5AFEFF]briefcase[/clr]![p]Once you've hit it, suck up the rope and then[p]start slamming with .[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Heh heh heh![tp:0.3] [/tp]It seems that you've also acquired[p]a new [clr:5AFEFF]elevator button[/clr], along with my [clr:5AFEFF]briefcase[/clr]![pb]Well done, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]. Come on back to the [clr:FFE98B]lab[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Stop fooling around, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp]Go to[p]my room and get my [clr:5AFEFF]briefcase[/clr]![pb]If you get turned around, you can always[p]check the map using the [clr:5AFEFF]VB[/clr].[tp:0.3] [/tp]But hurry![/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], what's taking you so long?[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]Go to my room and get my [clr:5AFEFF]briefcase[/clr]![pb]If you can't find your way, use the [clr:5AFEFF]VB[/clr] map![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Could you get a move on, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]?[tp:0.3] [/tp]You need to[p]get to my room and recover my [clr:5AFEFF]briefcase[/clr]![pb]You know where my room is, right?[p]Look closely at the [clr:5AFEFF]VB[/clr] map![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Hey, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]! Sorry, I was busy and just got back[p]to my desk. Did I miss anything important?[p]What's the status on my [clr:5AFEFF]briefcase[/clr]?[p]WHAT?! A ghost maid took off with it?[p]That won't do...[tp:0.3] [/tp]No, that won't do at all![pb]Don't just stand there! Get after her![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Don't waste your time searching every room and[p]looking in every little nook and cranny, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![pb]Certain ghosts leave traces behind in areas[p]they've passed through. Use [clr:5AFEFF]Dark-Light [/clr]with ,[p]and check the walls and doors for clues![/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], what are you doing?[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]Hurry up and come back to the [clr:FFE98B]lab[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Heh heh heh![tp:0.3] [/tp]I've caught you in my trap, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![pb]Oh, don't worry![tp:0.3] [/tp]I'm just kidding![tp:0.3] [/tp]But I[p]am going to need you to stay locked up.[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Why, you ask? Because I want you to use[p][clr:43D311]Gooigi[/clr] to try to escape from your cell![pb]You can activate [clr:43D311]Gooigi[/clr] with . [tp:0.3] [/tp][p]To recall him to his tank, press  twice.[/tp]
[tp:0.03]You can summon [clr:43D311]Gooigi[/clr] from the [clr:5AFEFF]Poltergust G-00[/clr][p]by pressing .[tp:0.3] [/tp]Press  twice to send him back.[/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:43D311]Gooigi[/clr] can slip through tight[p]spaces, like grates or vents.[pb]His body is incredibly soft and malleable.[p]It's really quite amazing![tp:0.03] [/tp]Go on! See for yourself![/tp]
[tp:0.03]There you go![tp:0.3] [/tp]He moves in basically the[p]same ways you do, so controlling him[p]shouldn't take much getting used to.[p]Oh, and that reminds me![tp:0.3] [/tp]Pressing  once[p][clr:43D311]Gooigi [/clr]is active will let you switch between[p]him and yourself. Remember that![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Heh heh heh![tp:0.3] [/tp][clr:43D311]Gooigi[/clr] isn't even[p]remotely waterproof, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![pb]If he gets wet at all, he'll melt and disappear![tp:0.3] [/tp][p]Be careful with him around anything wet.[/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr],[tp:0.3] [/tp]there's something I'd like for you to try out...[pb]Walk [clr:43D311]Gooigi[/clr] directly to me![tp:0.3] [/tp]I know it seems[p]like a silly request, but humor me, all right?[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]And follow my directions exactly![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Like I said before, you can switch between[p]yourself and [clr:43D311]Gooigi[/clr] by pressing .[pb]You can even do it while you're in the middle of[p]some other action, like using the [clr:5AFEFF]Poltergust G-00[/clr].[/tp]
[tp:0.03]You can quickly swap between[p][clr:98FC76]Luigi [/clr]and [clr:43D311]Gooigi[/clr] by pressing .[pb]If you were in the middle of doing something,[tp:0.3] [/tp]like[p]pulling on an object or sucking something up,[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]that won't stop when you change characters![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Heh heh heh![tp:0.3] [/tp]Well done, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp]I feel[p]like I can let you run loose with [clr:43D311]Gooigi[/clr]![pb]All right! We're done with your training, at[p]least for now.[tp:0.3] [/tp]Let's go back to the [clr:FFE98B]lab[/clr].[/tp]
Recover E. Gadd's Briefcase
[tp:0.03]Ah, I remember![tp:0.3] [/tp][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], I was staying in [clr:FFE98B]room 508[/clr]![pb]Use the [clr:5AFEFF]VB[/clr] to check where to go on the map;[p][clr:FFE98B]room 508 [/clr]is the one with the mark on it![/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], where are you going?[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]Don't forget about my [clr:5AFEFF]briefcase[/clr]![/tp]
Use Gooigi to Escape
[tp:0.03]Welcome back, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp][p]My [clr:5AFEFF]briefcase[/clr], chop-chop![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Heh heh heh![tp:0.3] [/tp]This! This is what I wanted![tp:0.3] [/tp][p]The time has come to use it in battle![/tp]
[tp:0.03]I'm too old to be out catching ghosts by myself.[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]Rather than give up on my ghostly pursuits,[p]I thought I'd create a helper to take my place.[/tp]
[tp:0.03]The latest invention from the brilliant mind[p]of [clr:FE7388]Professor E. Gadd[/clr]! I give you...[tp:0.3] [/tp][clr:43D311]Gooigi[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03]The development process was a real challenge,[p]to say the least. Fortunately, I had a little help[p]from [clr:98FC76]someone[/clr] to test the prototype![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Hm?[tp:0.3] [/tp]How is this going to help?[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]Now, now. Take it easy.[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Here, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]. I'm going to attach this to the[p][clr:5AFEFF]Poltergust G-00[/clr].[tp:0.3] [/tp]Turn around for me, would you?[/tp]
[tp:0.03]OK! It's all set up![/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], let's practice a bit.[tp:0.3] [/tp]Follow me outside![/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], it looks like you're able to get to [clr:FFE98B]3F [/clr]now![pb]But before you head there, bring my[p][clr:5AFEFF]briefcase [/clr]back to the [clr:FFE98B]lab[/clr]! I need it![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Hey! I asked you to come back to the [clr:FFE98B]lab[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp][p]I really would like my [clr:5AFEFF]briefcase[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Hey...[tp:0.3] [/tp]What are you doing, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]?[tp:0.3] [/tp]Hurry up[p]and get to [clr:FFE98B]5F[/clr]! My [clr:5AFEFF]briefcase[/clr] needs you![/tp]
[tp:0.12]...[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Nice work, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]! Very impressive, I must say![tp:0.3] [/tp][p]That reminds me of something I wanted to tell you.[/tp]
[tp:0.03]I've been running the sensors in the[p][clr:FFE98B]lab[/clr], and they've detected the presence[p]of a mysterious building.[/tp]
[tp:0.03]In fact, the ominous-looking tower[p]is very close to this very hotel![/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], I know you really want to find all of your[p]missing friends, but if you want a break from[p]that, you could head over to the tower![/tp]
[tp:0.03]It's probably crawling with ghosts[p]that you can catch.[tp:0.3] [/tp]Go on and test[p]your skills there![tp:0.3] [/tp]For science![/tp]
[tp:0.03]I've made arrangements so that you can[p]access the tower from the [clr:FFE98B]lab[/clr]. Just select[p][clr:FFE98B]ScareScraper [/clr]in Multiplayer.[tp:0.3] [/tp]Have fun![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Oh! Wait! I just remembered something else![tp:0.3] [/tp][p]You can check out[clr:FFE98B] ScreamPark[/clr] if you're feeling[p]a little bit lonely and want to have some fun.[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Up to eight people can play and compete[p]with one another![tp:0.3] [/tp]Fun! Heh heh heh![/tp]
[tp:0.03][tp:0.3]...[/tp]Oh right, you can get to a new floor now![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Head to the [clr:FFE98B]elevator[/clr] and take it to [clr:FFE98B]3F[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Ta-da![tp:0.3] [/tp]Behold![tp:0.3] [/tp]This is your very[p]own personal assistant, [clr:43D311]Gooigi[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]! Terrible news! The transfer system[p]is out of comission at the moment...[pb]Isn't it just your luck that something like this would[p]happen right when you needed it to...not happen?[pb]Anyway, you'll need to make your way back to[p]the [clr:FFE98B]lab[/clr] on foot. Good luck! See you soon![/tp]
[tp:0.03]By the way, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr],[tp:0.3] [/tp]here's a fun bit of trivia for you:[p]every time you go through a door, all of your[p]progress up to that point is saved. Automatically![p]But![tp:0.3] [/tp]It might not be if you move too quickly from[p]door to door to door to door to... You get the idea.[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]I'd say waiting...10 seconds should be enough![p]You know what they say: patience is a virtue![tp:0.3] [/tp][p]Keep up the good work![/tp]
[tp:0.03]I hope [clr:43D311]Gooigi[/clr] has been very helpful for you, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![pb]Don't forget that he can move through[p]tight spaces. Don't be afraid to use him![/tp]
[tp:0.03]The [clr:5AFEFF]Strobulb[/clr] isn't working because his eyes[p]are protected! Do something about those[p]sunglasses, and then strobe him![/tp]
[tp:0.03]The [clr:5AFEFF]Strobulb[/clr] isn't working because of[p]those sunglasses he's got on![tp:0.3] [/tp]I bet some[p]suction would pull them right off his face![/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], that looks like the wrong [clr:5AFEFF]key[/clr].[tp:0.3] [/tp]You might[p]be able to use that [clr:5AFEFF]key[/clr] someplace else.[/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], that [clr:5AFEFF]key[/clr] won't work![tp:0.3] [/tp]Without the right[p][clr:5AFEFF]key[/clr], you won't be able to get into that room...[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Here's a neat trick to easily suck up[p]big ghosts...[tp:0.3] [/tp]Move around them after[p]you've hit them with the [clr:5AFEFF]Strobulb[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03]He was quite an aggressive one, wasn't he?[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]I'm surprised you were able to catch him![pb]He'll be a big help to my research, though![tp:0.3] [/tp][p]Keep up the good work, OK?[tp:0.3] [/tp]Heh heh heh![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Going shopping, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]?[tp:0.3] [/tp]Now isn't really the best[p]time for that... Hurry up and get the [clr:5AFEFF]button[/clr]![/tp]

[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp]The elevator can take[p]you directly to [clr:FFE98B]Lobby 2F[/clr]![pb]You might as well head that[p]way and check it out, I say.[/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], did you see that?[tp:0.3] [/tp]That [clr:FA96FD]security[p]guard [/clr]had an [clr:5AFEFF]elevator button[/clr]![pb]It looks like he went into the[p][clr:FFE98B]security office[/clr].[tp:0.3] [/tp]Follow him! Go![/tp]
[tp:0.03]What you just saw were [clr:FA96FD]Spirit Balls[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp]Remember[p]those? Remember how they react when you hit[p]them with [clr:5AFEFF]Dark-Light[/clr]?[tp:0.3] [/tp]Oh, [clr:43D311]Gooigi[/clr] wasn't there...[p]For his sake, I'll remind you! If you use[p][clr:5AFEFF]Dark-Light [/clr]on suspicious areas,[tp:0.3] [/tp]you might[p]reveal [clr:FA96FD]Spirit Balls [/clr]that you can suck up![/tp]
[tp:0.03]What are you waiting for?![tp:0.3] [/tp][p]Use [clr:43D311]Gooigi[/clr] to suck up the [clr:FA96FD]Spirit Balls[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], you saw that [clr:FA96FD]security guard[/clr][p]with the [clr:5AFEFF]elevator button[/clr], right?[pb]It looks like he went into the[p][clr:FFE98B]security office[/clr].[tp:0.3] [/tp]Follow him![/tp]
[tp:0.03]What are you doing, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]?[tp:0.3] [/tp]That [clr:FA96FD]security[p]guard[/clr] isn't gonna chase itself![/tp]
[tp:0.03]My scientific instincts tell me that [clr:5AFEFF]key[p][/clr]you picked up doesn't work here.[p]Why don't you try a different room?[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Hmm, this [clr:FFE98B]accessory shop[/clr] seems pretty[p]suspicious to me... Look around and see if[p]there's anything you can use that [clr:5AFEFF]key[/clr] with.[/tp]
[tp:0.03]It'd be great to chase the [clr:FA96FD]security guard[p][/clr]into the [clr:FFE98B]security office[/clr], but it looks like you[p]won't be able to just stroll inside.[p]Maybe that [clr:5AFEFF]key[/clr] he dropped will open a[p]different way? The shape of the [clr:5AFEFF]key[p][/clr]could be a hint of some kind...[/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], there don't seem to be any places where you[p]could use that [clr:5AFEFF]key[/clr] around here. Maybe your time[p]would be better spent searching elsewhere?[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Looks like you can use that [clr:5AFEFF]key[/clr] in[p]this [clr:FFE98B]boutique[/clr].[tp:0.3] [/tp]You already know[p]exactly where to use it, don't you?[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Hm, I see you've gotten your hands on another[p][clr:5AFEFF]key[/clr]. Where do you think we can use this one?[pb]The shape of the key could be a clue.[p]Don't forget to make use of [clr:43D311]Gooigi[/clr].[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Water is [clr:43D311]Gooigi[/clr]'s greatest weakness![tp:0.3] [/tp][p]Don't let that water gun hit him![pb]Use your noggin, and think of a way to hit the[p]ghost with the [clr:5AFEFF]Strobulb[/clr] while dodging the water![/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], now's no time to dawdle![p]Use [clr:43D311]Gooigi[/clr] to take on that ghost![/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], are you sure you want to leave that[p][clr:FA96FD]security guard[/clr] alone for now?[tp:0.3] [/tp]He does[p]have an [clr:5AFEFF]elevator button[/clr], after all...[p]You should head back to [clr:FFE98B]3F[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Don't forget that you can aim the [clr:5AFEFF]Poltergust G-00[/clr][p]up and down using the motion controls, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![pb]You'll definitely need to do this when[p]there's something above or below[p]you that you want to suck up![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Don't tell me you've already forgotten your[p]training, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp]I'm talking about pressing  while[p]trying to suck something up, of course![p]If you press  while you're sucking something up,[p]you can switch between [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr] and [clr:43D311]Gooigi[/clr].[p]Whoever was sucking something up will keep at it![p]In other words, you can both vacuum at[p]the same time![tp:0.3] [/tp]Heh heh heh![/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], aren't you forgetting something a little[p]bit important?[tp:0.3] [/tp]Go collect the [clr:5AFEFF]elevator button[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03]You can't do it alone, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]. You need[p]more power![tp:0.3] [/tp]In situations like these,[p]you've got to work together![/tp]
[tp:0.03]He's not letting go of his frying pan![tp:0.3] [/tp][p]If he's that attached to cooking, maybe[p]you should send some ingredients his way![/tp]
[tp:0.03]There's so much smoke! How can you[p]see anything in that?![tp:0.3] [/tp]Can you use the[p][clr:5AFEFF]Poltergust G-00 [/clr]to clear things up a little?[/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], you're doing a great job![tp:0.3] [/tp]Why don't[p]you make your way back to the [clr:FFE98B]lab[/clr], OK?[p]There's something I want to tell you.[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]See you soon![/tp]

Check Out the Second Floor Again
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], there's something I want to talk to you[p]about.[tp:0.3] [/tp]Could you make your way back to the [clr:FFE98B]lab[/clr]?[/tp]
[tp:0.03]The mouse might be in this room, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp]You should[p]make full use of the [clr:5AFEFF]Suction Shot[/clr] here; move[p]everything you can, and find that mouse![/tp]
[tp:0.03]The mouse must have gone into the other[p][clr:FFE98B]restroom[/clr], but the entrance won't open...[pb]Is there some way that [clr:43D311]Gooigi[/clr] could[p]sneak in there from this room?[/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp]The mouse is probably hiding out[p]in the [clr:FFE98B]restroom[/clr]! It's probably glowing too,[p]since it swallowed the [clr:5AFEFF]elevator button[/clr]...[/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp]Get the [clr:5AFEFF]elevator button[/clr] back from[p]that mouse! I don't think it got too far.[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]Try checking around the [clr:FFE98B]restaurant[/clr].[/tp]
[tp:0.03]What are you doing, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]?[tp:0.3] [/tp]I'm certain the mouse[p]isn't there! You haven't given up on trying to catch[p]it, have you?[tp:0.3] [/tp]Of course you haven't...[p]Head in the direction that it ran off in![/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], I don't know where that mouse is[p]heading, but I'm positive it went out into the[p][clr:FFE98B]hallway[/clr]! Search every corner of the [clr:FFE98B]hallway[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]! Let's go hunt down that mouse![tp:0.3] [/tp][p]I think it ran into the [clr:FFE98B]restroom[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03]That mouse couldn't have gone very far, [tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr][/tp]![p]I doubt it escaped to an entirely different floor.[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]Let's head back to [clr:FFE98B]2F[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Oh, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]! You're finally back, eh?[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]You shouldn't keep an old man waiting, y'know.[/tp]

[tp:0.03]By the way, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]...[tp:0.3] [/tp]You must be getting pretty[p]good at exploring the hotel, am I right?[tp:0.3] [/tp]Have you[p]been sucking up stuff with the [clr:5AFEFF]Poltergust G-00[/clr]?[/tp]

[tp:0.03]Fret not. I have the perfect solution[p]to your cumbersome currency[p]conundrum...[tp:0.3] [/tp]Just give it all to me![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Drumroll, please! I'm proud to announce...[/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:FE7388]Professor E. Gadd[/clr]'s [clr:FFE98B]Shopping Network[/clr] is now[p]open for business right here in the [clr:FFE98B]lab[/clr]! Ta-daaaa![/tp]
[tp:0.03]I've stocked some rather useful items.[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]They're all yours...for a modest fee![tp:0.3] [/tp]Heh heh heh![/tp]
[tp:0.03]To celebrate the shop's grand opening, just[p]this once, I’m giving away a free [clr:5AFEFF]Gold Bone[/clr].[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Go on, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr].[tp:0.3] [/tp]Just select the [clr:5AFEFF]Gold Bone[/clr] to claim it.[/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:5AFEFF]Gold Bones[/clr] are incredible items that give[p]you a second wind if your health runs out.[/tp]
[tp:0.03]You'd be wise to keep a few on hand... So if you[p]want more, you'll have to buy them![tp:0.3] [/tp]Heh heh heh![/tp]
[tp:0.03]I've got other items in stock, so[p]feel free to browse![tp:0.3] [/tp]Heh heh heh![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Oh! I almost forgot![tp:0.3] [/tp]I have one other[p]matter to address while you're here.[/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], could you turn around for a moment?[p]I need to adjust your [clr:5AFEFF]Poltergust G-00[/clr]...[/tp]
[tp:0.03]...Annnnd done![tp:0.3] [/tp]I just added a new[p]feature to the [clr:5AFEFF]Poltergust G-00[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03]My research indicates that [clr:B996DC]Boos [/clr]are[p]hiding out in this hotel. I just added a[p]feature to help you track them down![tp:0.3] [/tp][p]Don't worry about the details—I'll fill you in later.[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Well then! That’s it from me, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]. Get back[p]out there and keep exploring the hotel![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Hey, it looks like you've stumbled[p]across a [clr:B996DC]Boo[/clr] already![/tp]
[tp:0.03]That's a sign that indicates there's a[p][clr:B996DC]Boo[/clr] nearby![tp:0.3] [/tp]Let me explain in more[p]detail.[tp:0.3] [/tp]Where are those note cards...[/tp]
[tp:0.03]You see, [clr:43D311]Gooigi[/clr]'s body is made of a material I've[p]dubbed "[clr:5AFEFF]Goo[/clr]."[tp:0.3] [/tp][clr:5AFEFF]Goo[/clr] reacts to the frequency emitted[p]by [clr:B996DC]Boos[/clr]. So if there's a [clr:B996DC]Boo[/clr] hiding nearby...[p]the [clr:5AFEFF]Goo[/clr] will vibrate to indicate this![/tp]
[tp:0.03]The closer you get to a [clr:B996DC]Boo[/clr]'s location, the[p]stronger the vibration will be. You'll definitely[p]be able to tell when you're really close![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Did that all make sense, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]?[tp:0.3] [/tp]A strong[p]vibration means a [clr:B996DC]Boo[/clr] is nearby![pb]OK! Get out there and catch a lot of [clr:B996DC]Boos[/clr]! I'll start[p]thinking about the best way to organize them...[/tp]

[tp:0.03]I think the levers in the chambers can be used to[p]seal the hole in the [clr:FFE98B]central chamber[/clr], [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![pb]But it also seems like pulling just one lever[p]won't be enough...[tp:0.3] [/tp]Look in the other chambers,[p]and see if you can find more levers![/tp]
[tp:0.03]It looks like there's some kind of scale at work...[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]And there are paintings of animals over there...[pb]I wonder what would happen if you put sand[p]on the scale and changed the weight around?[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]Maybe the paintings are a hint of some kind?[/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp]You're rapidly running out of space in that[p]room! Keep adjusting the weight on the scale to[p]line the needle up with the animal in the middle![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Having trouble, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]?[tp:0.3] [/tp]Use the [clr:5AFEFF]Poltergust G-00[p][/clr]to move the sand! And maybe check out that[p]suspicious statue while you're at it...[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Those lasers are bringing down the roof, literally![p]You'll need to find a way to disable them! I bet you[p]can use the sand to make a path for yourself![/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], it looks like there's a hole in that wall.[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]You might be able to insert something in there,[p]now that I really think about it.[p]Maybe there's something hidden in the[p]sand that would fit?[tp:0.3] [/tp]Take a look![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Oh no! [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], if this keeps up, you'll be poisoned![tp:0.3] [/tp][p]Hurry up and plug those holes in the wall![tp:0.3] [/tp][p]Something in the sand must be able to help you![/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp]That monster is covered in sand![tp:0.3] [/tp][p]Use the [clr:5AFEFF]Poltergust G-00[/clr] to pull all that sand away![/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], aren't you interested in the pyramid?[tp:0.3] [/tp]Where's[p]your curious spirit? Your sense of adventure?![pb]Come on, let's go back to [clr:FFE98B]10F[/clr] and check it out![p]Only good things come from pyramids![tp:0.3] [/tp]Mostly...[/tp]

[tp:0.03]Hm? There's one [clr:FE7388]Toad[/clr] missing?[tp:0.3] [/tp]Uh... Right.[p]That was the bad thing I'd mentioned.[/tp]
[tp:0.03]You see, I was actually thinking about[p]further modifying your [clr:5AFEFF]Poltergust G-00[/clr].[p]You know, powering it up.[/tp]
[tp:0.03]I was confident that the [clr:5AFEFF]part[/clr] I would[p]need to modify the [clr:5AFEFF]Poltergust G-00[/clr] was[p]in the hotel...[tp:0.3] [/tp]So I had [clr:FE7388]Toad[/clr] go look for it.[/tp]
[tp:0.03]But...[tp:0.3] [/tp]Well, come have a look at this, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr].[p]It's footage from a camera I gave [clr:FE7388]Toad[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03]It seems [clr:FE7388]Toad[/clr] was attacked by a ghost in[p]the place where the footage was taken.[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Listen, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp]This footage is a clue![tp:0.3] [/tp]You'll have[p]to use what was in the footage to track [clr:FE7388]Toad[/clr] down![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Oh! But above all else, you simply[p]must bring me that [clr:5AFEFF]part[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03]My invention is at stake.[tp:0.3] [/tp]You obviously agree that[p]this is a mission of the utmost importance, right?[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]Heh heh heh![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Get to it, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Ah![tp:0.3] [/tp]Thanks for bringing back the[p][clr:5AFEFF]part[/clr], [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp]Now hand it over![/tp]
[tp:0.03]What are you doing?[tp:0.3] [/tp]Give me the[p][clr:5AFEFF]Poltergust G-00[/clr] too! Come on, COME ON![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Heh heh heh![tp:0.3] [/tp]Now what do you[p]think of that![tp:0.3] [/tp]I've completed my[p]modifications to the [clr:5AFEFF]Poltergust G-00[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03]I call it [clr:5AFEFF]Super Suction[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp]It has increased the[p]suction power exponentially![/tp] Heh heh heh!
[tp:0.03]...Unfortunately, you have to plug it in to a special[p]electrical socket in order to use [clr:5AFEFF]Super Suction[/clr].[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]A minor inconvenience that you can surely handle![/tp]
[tp:0.03]I'm sure you'll be able to find a few such sockets[p]in this hotel.[tp:0.3] [/tp]Try it out as soon as you find one![/tp]
[tp:0.03]By the way, didn't you mention before[p]that there was part of a boat in your way[p]in [clr:FFE98B]The Spectral Catch[/clr], [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]?[/tp]
[tp:0.03]That'd be no match for the overwhelming power[p]of [clr:5AFEFF]Super Suction[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp]Head back there, and look for[p]one of those electrical sockets I mentioned![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Ah![tp:0.3] [/tp]I remember![tp:0.3] [/tp]This way, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp]If we go this way,[p]the exit should be through here![/tp]

[tp:0.03]I told you to hurry back to the [clr:FFE98B]lab[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp]Get here! Now![/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], come back to the [clr:FFE98B]lab[/clr].[tp:0.3] [/tp]I'm going[p]to power up your [clr:5AFEFF]Poltergust G-00[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], you're going to need to look for another[p]path if you want to get out of here! Follow the[p]waterway, and don't forget about your [clr:5AFEFF]VB[/clr] map![/tp]
[tp:0.03]It looks like there's a door leading elsewhere, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr].[p]Buuuut[tp:0.09]...[/tp]it doesn't look like you can open it yet.[p]The door seems to be missing a part...[p]Maybe you can ask [clr:FE7388]Toad[/clr] for help[p]looking for whatever is missing?[/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], you didn't miss that door in the dead end, did[p]you?[tp:0.3] [/tp]I bet you could escape that way! Head back[p]to the end of that tunnel in [clr:FFE98B]drainage control[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp]Please don't leave me here![/tp]

[tp:0.03]Look, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]! There's a door![tp:0.3] [/tp]Hang on...[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]It doesn't look like it has a handle.[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Hey, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]! That's not the way to the [clr:FFE98B]lab[/clr].[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]Hurry up and get back there![/tp]

[tp:0.03]There seems to be a door, but the way[p]is blocked by a giant ship, so we can't[p]proceed...[tp:0.3] [/tp]Do we just...give up?[/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]! Come back to the [clr:FFE98B]lab[/clr] as soon as you can![p]Something bad has happened![pb]I'll give you the details when you get here,[p]so just hurry back, OK?[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Umm...[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]This isn't the right way...[/tp]

[tp:0.03]Maybe [clr:B996DC]King Boo[/clr] will decide to display you[p]next to this painting...[tp:0.3] [/tp]I'll have to ask him![/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luiiiiiiigi[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp]If you want to save [clr:FE7388]Mario[/clr],[p]you'll have to come and find me![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Try not to faint from sheer terror before[p]then.[tp:0.3] [/tp]I'll be waiting in anticipation![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Well well well...[tp:0.3] [/tp]I honestly didn't[p]think you'd have it in you.[/tp]
[tp:0.03]A scaredy-cat like you, making it[p]this far... You're just FULL of surprises![/tp]
[tp:0.03]You ransacked my hotel, captured my staff[p]with that strange vacuum of yours...[/tp]
[tp:0.03]And to top it all off, you catnapped[p]my sweetie, my little darling...[/tp]
[tp:0.03]My precious [clr:FA96FD]Polterkitty[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03]This isn't how it was supposed to happen![/tp]
[tp:0.03]You weren't supposed to run away[p]from [clr:B996DC]King Boo [/clr]like a filthy coward![/tp]
[tp:0.03]If you'd just let yourself get caught in that[p]painting, [clr:B996DC]King Boo[/clr] would have showered me[p]with praise for my brilliant trap![/tp]
[tp:0.03]But instead...[tp:0.3] [/tp]Instead...[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]I'VE LOST EVERYTHING! BECAUSE OF YOU![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Ahem...[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]Shall we begin?[/tp]
[tp:0.03]I suppose I'll just have to deal with you myself.[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]Then [clr:B996DC]King Boo[/clr] will trust me once more and[p]recognize how useful I can be to him![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Are you ready, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]?[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]Do try to make this enjoyable for me![/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], this floor must be heavily guarded.[p]Make use of the [clr:5AFEFF]Virtual Boo[/clr] and [clr:5AFEFF]Poltergust G-00[/clr],[p]and find a way into the [clr:FA96FD]hotel owner[/clr]'s room![/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]! You can't run away now![p]Head back to [clr:FFE98B]15F[/clr], and give that horrible[p][clr:FA96FD]hotel owner [/clr]the whooping of her afterlife![/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], did you see that?[tp:0.3] [/tp]That was your[p]big brother! That means the [clr:FA96FD]hotel owner[p][/clr]is finally making an appearance![tp:0.3] [/tp][p]It's finally time for you two to face off![p]Track down the [clr:FA96FD]hotel owner[/clr] and rescue [clr:FE7388]Mario[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Look out, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]! There are invisible[p]lasers all over the place![pb]See that powder on the floor? I bet you could use[p]Burst to blow it up into the air![tp:0.3] [/tp]That'd probably[p]reveal the lasers, even just for a short time.[/tp]
Rescue Peach
Defeat King Boo and Rescue Everyone
[tp:0.03]Mwa ha ha! How brash of you[p]to come and face me, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03]You should have just run away[p]while you had the chance![/tp]
[tp:0.03]But instead you stayed and fought all the[p]way up here to oppose me?[tp:0.3] [/tp]How foolish![/tp]
[tp:0.03]You may have made your way through the[p]hotel using [clr:FE7388]E. Gadd[/clr]'s frustrating inventions[p]to suck up all the ghosts in your path...[/tp]
[tp:0.03]You were all "SHWEEERRPP-SHLOOOOP-[p]WHOOORPP-SHLEEEOOORG!"[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Ahem.[tp:0.5] [/tp]Anyway, just because you vacuumed up all[p]of those ghosts doesn't mean you can take me on![p]It doesn't matter that you beat the [clr:FA96FD]hotel owner[/clr]... [/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:FA96FD]Hellen Gravely[/clr]![tp:0.3] [/tp]Ooooooo![tp:0.3] [/tp]She let all your friends [p]get away![tp:0.3] [/tp]It's so frustrating when you trap[p]something in a painting and it gets out, you know?[/tp]
[tp:0.03]Arg! [clr:FA96FD]Hellen Gravely[/clr]... All those ghosts...[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]Useless! I have to do everything myself![/tp]
[tp:0.03]I'm sick of this! No more mercy for you, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03]No more tricks—no more carefully laid plans![p]Now it's time for raw [clr:B996DC]King Boo[/clr] gusto![/tp]
[tp:0.03]You're all going in a painting![p]An ensemble portrait is your fate![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Mwa ha ha! Serves you right![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Just a few left. Go on! Join them![p]My painting must be complete![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Sorry to keep you waiting.[p]Are you ready?[tp:0.3] [/tp]I don't care![/tp]
[tp:0.03]...Hm?[tp:0.3] [/tp]One-two-three-four-five-six-sev[tp:0.3]—[/tp] WAIT![/tp]
[tp:0.03]There should be seven! Who's missing?![/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]! What are you doing over there?![/tp]
[tp:0.03]UGH! That's it! I'm sick to double death of you![/tp]
[tp:0.03]You want to fight me? FINE! Let's go, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03]This is the end for you, once and[p]for all! HERE I COME![/tp]

[tp:0.03]Sorry, I don't have any new information[p]for you.[tp:0.3] [/tp]Keep exploring the hotel![/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], I know saving your friends is[p]important, but don't forget about[p]collecting ghosts![tp:0.3] [/tp]Heh heh heh![/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], I've got nothing for you![tp:0.3] [/tp]...I mean,[p]nothing but confidence...in your ability...[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]to...figure this out on your own?[tp:0.3] [/tp]Yeah, that![/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], now's not the time to be contacting me![p]Focus on taking care of the job at hand![/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], if you ever get stuck while you're[p]exploring, remember to try out all the[p]amazing features of the [clr:5AFEFF]Poltergust G-00[/clr]![p]Try shining [clr:5AFEFF]Dark-Light[/clr] on various places, or[p]utilize your [clr:5AFEFF]Suction Shot[/clr]![/tp]
[tp:0.03][clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr], have you explored every last nook[p]and cranny of this hotel, top to bottom?[p]It's important to be thorough![p]If you ever get stuck, look at the [clr:5AFEFF]VB[/clr]'s map and see[p]if there are any places you haven't visited yet![/tp]
[tp:0.03]Geez, what have I gotten myself into now...[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]Just when you think you'll have a nice, relaxing[p]vacation at a luxury hotel, THIS happens...[p]I guess the beautiful appearance of the place[p]was all part of the trick to get us here, huh?[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]The hotel's true form is downright creepy.[/tp]
[tp:0.03]So you were also invited to this hotel, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]?[p]Was it a pleasant letter that made the place sound[p]so amazing that you absolutely had to come? [p]They also wrote to me about having a fantastic[p]collection of ghosts I could get my hands on,[p]so I came here as soon as I was able![p]Obviously it was all a ruse to trap me...[/tp]
[tp:0.03]As you know, I'm the leading authority on ghost[p]research, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr].[tp:0.3] [/tp]It can only be fate that we would[p]meet again under these circumstances.[tp:0.3] [/tp]Lucky us![p]Now then, get moving and use the [clr:5AFEFF]Poltergust G-00[/clr][p]to catch as many ghosts as you can.[tp:0.3] [/tp][p]Science is always hungry for progress![/tp]
[tp:0.03]By the way, [clr:98FC76]Luigi[/clr]...[tp:0.3] [/tp]How much money have[p]you collected so far? I hope you'll be able[p]to line your pockets while we're here! [p]Heh heh heh![/tp]
